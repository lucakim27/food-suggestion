# food-suggestion

## Overview  
The **food-suggestion** is a web-based application designed to help users find the most suitable Korean meals based on their dietary restrictions, health goals, taste preferences, and more. By integrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, the application is both modular and maintainable. Future updates will include machine learning models to further enhance recommendations through personalized user data analysis.

---

## Features  
- Dynamic filtering system based on multiple criteria like dietary restrictions, health goals, and cooking equipment.  
- Modular code structure leveraging **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles for better scalability and maintainability.  
- User-friendly interface with recommendations displayed in a clean and structured format.  
- Dataset of 100+ Korean dishes enriched with key attributes like dietary details, cooking requirements, and sustainability.  

---

## Frameworks  
- **Python Flask**: A lightweight web framework for building the backend and handling API requests.  

---

## Deployment  
The application will be hosted on:  
- **Amazon AWS EC2** (Deployment in progress)  

---

## Live Link  
- The live website link will be added after deployment is complete.  

---

## Upcoming Machine Learning Integration
- Personalized Recommendations: Machine learning models will analyze user preferences and behaviors to suggest dishes tailored to individual tastes.
- Future Datasets: Plans to incorporate additional datasets and leverage clustering algorithms to group users with similar preferences.
